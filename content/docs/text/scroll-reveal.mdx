## Installation

<Steps>

<Step>(optional): Update globals.css</Step>

This is just for changing the color of the icon once it is revealed. You can skip this step if you don't want to change the color.

```css
.scroll-baby[style*="opacity: 1"] {
  @apply text-yellow-300 dark:text-yellow-500;
}

.scroll-file[style*="opacity: 1"] {
  @apply text-blue-300 dark:text-blue-500;
}
```

<Step>Run the following command</Step>

It will create a new file `scroll-reveal.tsx` inside the `components/mage-ui/text` directory.

```bash
mkdir -p components/mage-ui/text && touch components/mage-ui/text/scroll-reveal.tsx
```

<Step>Paste the code</Step>{" "}

Open the newly created file and paste the following code:

```jsx file=<rootDir>/mage-ui/text/scroll-reveal.tsx

```

</Steps>
